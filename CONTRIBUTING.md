### Code style
  * use [smart  tabs](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SmartTabs) (tablatures for
    indentation, spaces for presentation)
  * place block-opening curly quotes on  their own lines (expect for objects and
    CSS blocks)
  * write  comments  and  commit  messages  in  the  imperative style,  with  an
    uppercase letter at the beginning and no full stop at the end
